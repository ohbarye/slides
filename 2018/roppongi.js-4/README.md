## Issue List

First of all, see the "good first issue" [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-2jhSCFZUWyFsubCnGiX-xui9nA76M783Z2SOfVrEU4/edit#gid=440574128).

## How to make the list

---

To make it, I wrote a simple script in https://github.com/ohbarye/goofi.

***

1. Call GitHub GraphQL API
2. Format its response
3. Create CSV

---

GraphQL Query

***

<image src="./query.png" width="100%">

>>>

"good-first-issues:>1"

***

<image src="./query2.png" width="100%">


ref: [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-repositories/#search-based-on-number-of-issues-with-good-first-issue-or-help-wanted-labels)

>>>

"stars:>500"

***

ref: [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-repositories/#search-by-number-of-stars)

### Response

Once we can easily get data via the GitHub API, it's not a hard task to format the data.

---

Now that we have the candidate list, all we have to do is check issues one by one.

## Another way

Use [Jasper](https://jasperapp.io/)

<image src="./jasper.png" width="100%">

>>>

Create a stream to find "good first issues"

***

<image src="./jasper_stream.png" width="100%">

## NOTE

I used to find issues with this way, but...

* It cannot sort repositories by stars count
* It cannot reject wrong usage of "good first issue"
* It notifies me every when an issue is updated

In short, that was too noisy.

---

## Are they really nice ways? ðŸ¤”

---

At least, I could have contributed some popular repositories even though I was not familiar with them.

***

e.g. Node.js

## Let's find your "good first issues"
